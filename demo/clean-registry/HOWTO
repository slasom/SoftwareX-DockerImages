## Cleaning the Internal Minikube Registry

### Run the following script to load images into the internal registry:

./load-images-internal-registry.yaml

### Then, execute the script that retains only the last 3 most recent versions of each image, deleting the older ones:

./clean-registry.sh

This process applies to all repositories within the registry. If desired, filtering by a specific repository can be implemented directly in the script.
